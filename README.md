# Blogging application - ECE Webtech project

Welcome to our digital publishing application created as part of the Web Technologies course during the fall semester of 2023. Our application is a versatile platform designed to showcase the knowledge and skills we acquired throughout the semester. The key features of our application include:

1. **User Authentication:** We have implemented a robust OAuth2 authentication system, allowing users to log in using external providers such as GitHub. This ensures a secure and user-friendly login experience.

2. **Content Management:** Users can create, publish, and store articles within a structured database. This feature empowers users to share their thoughts, stories, or any content they wish to showcase.

3. **Community Interaction:** To foster lively discussions and interactions, we have incorporated a commenting feature. Users can engage with posts by leaving reviews, creating a sense of community within the platform.

4. **Navigation and Accessibility:** We prioritized an intuitive and accessible interface to ensure users can easily navigate through posts and comments. A well-designed navigation system enhances the overall user experience.

5. **User Profile Customization:** Our application allows users to personalize their profiles and settings. This customization feature adds a personal touch to the user experience.

## Miscellaneous

### Course Feedback

It was a very nice course, the labs are well explained and the course material is good. The project is very good for putting into practice everything we have learned and it is at this moment that we encounter the potential of what we are doing. We appreciate the well-structured labs that guided us through the process of building our project incrementally. This approach allowed us to comprehend each part independently, fostering a deeper understanding of various web technologies.

### Project Reuse

- We authorize the professors to use our project as an example for the next year students.
